Order of magnitude improvements in collision detection performance over time. Blue dots represent CPU methods otherwise green dots indicate the algorithm is GPU driven. Orange squares represent particle collision detection methods exclusively, otherwise the approach is many-body. White starts indicate the methods end-to-end processing is \textit{broad-narrow-render}, otherwise it is \textit{broad-narrow}. A table of explaining these esimates is provided in supplimentail information, Sec. \ref{suppliment}.
