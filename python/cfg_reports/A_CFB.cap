Collision fraction benchmark (CFB). The average time to process an increasing collision fraction while holding the number of particles constant. The mean time for the compute pipeline is \ACFBcmsMean{} ms, with a standard deviation of \ACFBcmsmstd{} ms, for an error of \ACFBcmserr{}\%. The mean time for the graphics pipeline is \ACFBgmsMean{} ms, with a standard deviation of \ACFBgmsmstd{} ms, for an error of \ACFBgmserr{}\%. These results indicate that both the compute and graphics pipelines are insensitive to the number of collisions.
