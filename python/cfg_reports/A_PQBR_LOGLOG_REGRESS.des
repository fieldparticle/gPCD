Log--log regression of execution time $t_n$ versus particle count $N$. The measured data (circles) are fit by a straight line (solid), corresponding to a power-law model 
$t_n = \alpha N^{b}$. The fitted slope of $b \approx 1$ confirms near-linear 
scaling in practice, despite the $O(N^{2})$ theoretical bound of collision 
detection. The regression achieved $R^{2} > 0.99$ for compute (\APQBRLOGLOGREGRESScmsrtwosat{}) and graphics (\APQBRLOGLOGREGRESSgmsrtwosat{}) indicating that the throughput follows a consistent scaling law, with deviations only at small 
$N$ due to fixed overheads before GPU saturation is reached at 
$N \approx 10^{6}$.
