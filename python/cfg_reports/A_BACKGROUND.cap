(a) Number of publications related to discrete particle simulation in the past 20 years, obtained from the Web of Science with the following keywords: \textit{discrete element method/model}, \textit{distinct element method/model}, \textit{discrete particles}, \textit{simulation/method/model}, and \textit{granular dynamic simulation}. Reproduced in part from Zhu et.al. \citep{zhu2007}.(b) shows order of magnitude improvements in collision detection performance over time. Blue dots represent CPU methods otherwise green dots indicate the algorithm is GPU driven. Orange squares represent particle collision detection methods exclusively, otherwise the approach is many-body. White stars indicate that the method end-to-end processing is \textit{broad-narrow-render}, otherwise it is \textit{broad-narrow}. A table providing details of these esimates is provided in supplimentail information, Sec. \ref{suppliment}.
