Details of PCD performance improvements from 1995 to 2025. The \textbf{Type} column identifies the collision object type. \textit{md} is a multi-body method that performs collision detection for objects more complex than particles. \textit{p} identifies methods that are exclusively PCD. \textbf{e2e} supplies the type of end-to-end processing. \textit{bn} means broad and narrow, while \textit{bnr} indicates broad, narrow, and render. \textbf{tpp} is the time per particle in nanoseconds. The \textbf{Estimate} column provides more detail on how the performance of each method was calculated.
