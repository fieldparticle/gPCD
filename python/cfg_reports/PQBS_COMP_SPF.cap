Results of PQB compute pipline sequential order. The overall frame-rate performance represented by the green dotted line. 
The linear fit, represented by the red squares, has a base cost of \PQBSCOMPSPFLinearTrendK{} s. The quadratic fit, 
represented by the blue circles, has a base cost of \PQBSCOMPSPFQuadraticTrendK{}s. 
The line exhibits strong linear features.
