The total PQBR performance which is the sum of the graphics and compute processing times.
Three trend-lines have been fit to the data for comparison with sequential algorithms having the 
same parameters. For a quadratic fit the base cost, 
K = \PQBRTOTALSPFQuadraticTrendK{} and a linear fit has a K=\PQBRTOTALSPFLinearTrendK{}.
