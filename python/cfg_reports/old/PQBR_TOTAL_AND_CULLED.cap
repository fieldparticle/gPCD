(a) shows the results of PQB random particle positions, with the overall frame-rate performance represented by the black +, the compute performance in the red squares, and graphics in the blue circles. The compute pipeline accounts for most of the processing time and grows disproportionately with the graphics performance. (b) shows the performance profile for small number of particles. The line levels at about \numprint{\PQBRTablePerfAllrowBcolA{}} so these outliers have been removed from the analysis.
