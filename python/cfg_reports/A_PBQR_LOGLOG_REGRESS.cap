og--log regression of total execution time $T(N)$ versus particle count $N$ 
on the NVIDIA RTX~3500 Ada Generation Laptop GPU. The measured data (circles) 
are fit by a straight line (solid), corresponding to a power-law model 
$T(N) = \alpha N^{b}$. The fitted slope of $b \approx 1$ confirms near-linear 
scaling in practice, despite the $O(N^{2})$ theoretical bound of collision 
detection. The regression achieved $R^{2} > 0.99$, indicating that the 
throughput follows a consistent scaling law, with deviations only at small 
$N$ due to fixed overheads before GPU saturation is reached at 
$N \approx 10^{4}$.
