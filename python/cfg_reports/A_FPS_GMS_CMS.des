A plot of the CPU time versus the graphics, compute, and total processing times. The CPU time is calculated as frames per second which is the time between command packets sent by Vulkan. The graphics and compute times are returned from the device timers. The CPU time is the inverse of frames per second which are rounded to decimal. This rounding accounts for the CPU time being less than the total time. The plot compares times recorded at the CPU and GPU to insure that the data is in proportion thereby verifiing the timings are correct.
